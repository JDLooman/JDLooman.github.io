                            A two-to-four player arcade fighting style game in which players slice their opponents to splatter paint on the battlefield. 
                            Use trampolines to do tricks and fight for aerial superiority. Having the most paint on the battlefield will make you victorious, 
                            but be careful because your opponents can paint over what you have already.

                            As you make contact with the mother, the father, and their two kids, you must use your mystical powers, as well as your skills of deduction, to enter their minds and make your way through their manifested hopes and fears to save the young child.

                <p>
                    Hi there,
                    <br>
                    <br>                    
                    My name is Justin Looman and am currently a 4th year at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a game developer who loves to create and balance worlds for myself and others to enjoy and explore.
                    I have experience leading multiple projects like Ninjas on Trampolines, ChangelingVR, Icarus, and Helpless. Through my time leading these projects I have learned how to bring together multiple disciplines
                    and create the best possible product. My most recent project Ninjas on Trampolines is currently going through the Maker program at RIT with MAGIC Spell Studios.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My passion for gaming goes all the way back to when I was a kid. Playing games and getting lost for hours, often getting me into trouble, made many core memories. Now I'm looking to return the favor and 
                    bring many good memories to those experienced and new to gaming.
                </p>
